# 🎤 Speech Signal Processing – Digit Recognition  

📌 **Description**  
This project was developed as part of a university assignment in Speech and Audio Signal Processing.  
It uses Python and the `scikit-learn` library to classify spoken digits from audio signals.  

👨‍💻 **Technologies used:**  
- Python  
- scipy  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

⚡ **Features:**  
- Data preprocessing: resampling at 8000Hz, autocorrelation for fundamental frequency  
- Spectrogram generation using Fourier transforms  
- Scaling with MinMaxScaler  
- Classification with **Support Vector Machines (LinearSVC)** (one-vs-all)  
- Achieved ~70% accuracy in digit classification  

📂 **Repository Contents:**  
- `Report.pdf` → Full project documentation  
- `ergasia.py` → Python code with preprocessing, spectrograms, and SVM training  
- `Files/` → Free Spoken Digit Dataset (3000 audio samples)
